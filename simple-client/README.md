This is a simple client used to illustrate a login form with a dynamic
response based from a content microservice.

Run it with

`npm start`

Per instructions of "the client is not an important part of the coding exercise"
little time was spent on sane code organization or UI styling/layout, but
instead illustrating display of either a login form, or a list of meditations.

It was built with `create-react-app` v1.4.3
